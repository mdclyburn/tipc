In the system tests, two tests have been added to the suite to demonstrate the new functionality: selftests/polyprog2.tip, and . Selftests/polyprog2.tip shows the new let polymorphism-enabled functionality, and ** deliniates the command-line enabled difference. To support the second test, run.sh has been altered slightly.

Both of these two tests pass. However, in regression testing, three additional tests programs failed. The first two were selftests/polyprog.tip and selftests/returnrecord.tip. These each had test results that expected the more constrained type for the function/record and function locals/record members. Since we intentionally changed this functionality, the tests were altered to reflect the changes. The third one was iotests/linkedlist.tip. This function segfaults when attempting to print a Î¼ var with an associated tipvar of null, which this test and no others use. We were unable to correct this before submission.
